        <p>
          Revolt started in 2021 as a small project by a group of friends who
          wanted to create a chat app that was truly built with the user in
          mind. We wanted to create a space where people could come together,
          chat, and build communities, in a way that was open, secure, and
          customisable.

        <p>
          From the very beginning, we knew that we wanted to make Revolt
          open-source. We believe that open-source software is the best way to
          build a community around a product, and we wanted to give our users
          the ability to see exactly what we were doing with their data.

        <p>
          We believe that chat apps should be more than just a way to send
          messages. They should be a place where people can come together, share
          ideas, and build communities. We want to create a chat app that is
          truly built with the user in mind.
