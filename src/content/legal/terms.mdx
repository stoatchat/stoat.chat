### **Introduction**

We get that legal documents can be overwhelming and boring, so we've tried our best to keep it as simple and possible while providing the information needed. It is important however to remember that these terms are legally binding between yourself and us if you choose to use Revolt, so please read them carefully before proceeding - We will continue to improve and tackle some sections.

### Definitions

Throughout this document, we will use certain terminology to refer to things specific to us, so let's establish what everything means:

-   **Terms** – the Terms of Service, a legally binding agreement between Us and You ("Terms", "Terms of Service")
-   **You** – the user ("you", "your" or "user")
-   **Revolt Platforms Ltd** – the company providing the service ("us", "we", "our")
-   **Revolt** – the service provided by us ("Revolt", "Platform", "Service" or "Application")
-   **Subscription** – a paid plan that provides access to additional features or services on Revolt ("Subscription", "Paid Service")
-   **Billing Cycle** – the period for which you are billed for a Subscription (e.g., monthly, yearly)

Your access to and use of the service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use our services. By accessing or using the service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then please discontinue the use of this service.

### **Understanding what we are**

As we continue to improve our services, we may need to make changes to our Terms of Service in the future. We will notify you of any changes by posting the updated Terms of Service on this page and specifying the effective date. Additionally, we may send you an email notification or display a notice within the Service.

Some features of the Service may be available only through a paid Subscription.

Subscriptions are available on a monthly or annual basis. Subscription fees are subject to change and may include applicable taxes. Accepted payment methods are listed on our payment page.

- **Billing:** You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing Cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the Subscription plan you select.
- **Payment:** You must provide accurate and complete billing information. By submitting payment information, you authorize us to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
- **Renewal:** Your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or we cancel it. You may cancel your Subscription at any time through your account settings to avoid future charges.
- **Free Trial:** If you sign up for a free trial (where available), you will be automatically converted to a paid Subscription at the end of the trial period unless you cancel before the trial ends.

No refunds will be provided for the remaining period of the Subscription after cancellation, except where required by law or in the event of a billing error.
- **Account Termination:** If your account is terminated for violating these Terms or our Community Guidelines, your Subscription will be automatically cancelled and you will lose access to your Subscription and any associated features. No refunds will be provided for the remaining period of the Subscription after termination, except where required by law or in the event of a billing error.
- **Changes to Subscription Terms:** We reserve the right to modify Subscription fees or terms at any time. Any fee or term change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle. We will provide you with at least 14 days' prior notice of any change in Subscription fees or terms to give you an opportunity to cancel your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
- **User Responsibilities:** You are responsible for providing accurate and complete payment information and for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.
