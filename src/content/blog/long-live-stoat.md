Remember when you first found us? That feeling of "finally, a platform that gets
it"? We're about to give you that feeling all over again.

**Revolt is now Stoat**.

Before you panic: your servers are still there. Your friends are waiting. Your
deep fried emoji remain intact. And we'll keep being what we always were: a chat
app where you are the main character[^1], not executives or shareholders.

## Stoat Hits Different

When we started this journey, we were rebels. We wanted to revolt against
boring, corporate platforms that didn't understand what real communities needed.
That mission hasn't changed one bit. We've grown alongside you. Late-night
gaming sessions and study groups, meme exchanges, meaningful conversations. With
Voice Chats 2.0[^2] around the corner, we suddenly need to be all that.

We can't just be rebels anymore. We also want to be builders, creators,
connectors. The place where your 3am thoughts find their people. Where your
weirdest interests become your strongest friendships. Where chaos and community
collide in the best possible way.

The [stoat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoat), an animal native to Eurasia
and the northern regions of North America, represents everything we've become
together: quick, clever, unexpectedly powerful, and absolutely impossible to
ignore. Like our new and first mascot (yes, of course, also a stoat!), which
we'll be sharing in due time, we're small but mighty, playful but purposeful. We
do things with agility, creating spaces where you can be authentically,
unapologetically you.

## What's Actually Changing?

**`1` 🏷️ The Name**

Our name is now Stoat. Our primary domain is now
[stoat.chat](https://stoat.chat). Our handle is
[@stoatchat](https://github.com/stoatchat)[^3]. Server invite links are at
`stt.gg`. There are more changes that will be documented in due
time&mdash;developers should stay tuned for announcements coming soon.

**`2` 🎨 Fresh Visual Identity (Rolling out in phases)**

Let's be honest, right now you're looking at the previous Revolt website with a
purple paint job, maybe lime sometimes, and with a placeholder icon. We are
aware. The full visual transformation is coming, including our very awesome
mascot that's in the very process of being brought to life. What you see right
now is more of a announcement-level soft launch before the real launch.

**`3` 🚀 Same Foundation, Better Everything**

Your servers, messages, friends, ...? They're all exactly where you left them.
They're even on the same platform. We just changed names.

## Questions, But Answered

**"Do I need to do anything?"**\
Absolutely not. Your login works exactly the same. Your communities are
untouched. The only thing you need to do is tell as many people as possible.

**"Right&hellip; Why the rebrand _really_?"**\
Every growing platform reaches a moment where it needs to "level up" in a way.
Decisions made at day one don't always work at day 1461, even if this fact often
isn't visible on the outside. In this case, let's just say that sometimes the
universe makes decisions for you. Between some trademark considerations and our
desire to better represent our platform, all possible timing was perfect right
now, right here.

**"Is the team the same?"**\
Yes. 100%. Same developers, same community team, same people who've been
building this thing and listening to your feedback since the first day. We just
have cooler business cards now. That was a metaphor, we haven't printed business
cards yet. But if we did, they would look cool.

## Road Ahead

This rebrand isn't just about a new name or fresh colors. It's actually a
statement of intent. We're committing to:

- **Release MORE features FASTER** based on your actual requests (somehow a wild
  concept)
- **Better CREATOR TOOLS** for those that build communities
- **Continued OPERATIONAL INDEPENDENCE** from the big US based companies where
  feasible in the current year
- **A pledge to PRIVACY** notably still bound to GDPR and previous commitments
- **Increased focus on ACCESSIBILITY** to make sure everyone can use Stoat

No, we're not trying to be everything to everyone. That was never the goal, and
it's not possible to do. What we're building is the perfect platform for people
who really get it. People like you who value apps that value them, while also
being usable.

## So Join Us in Writing the Next Chapter

Change can be weird. We get it. Humans are wired to think this way[^4]. But
sometimes the best things come from embracing the chaos and seeing where it
takes us. Stoat isn't just our new name, it's a promise. A promise to keep
pushing boundaries, to keep your communities at the heart of every decision, and
to never, ever become one of those soulless platforms.

One more thing:
