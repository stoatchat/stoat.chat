Additional data processors are being added to the Privacy Policy to help accomodate further work on Revolt:

- Scaleway: to provide us with cloud services such as email processing; we've encountered issues with our emails being blocked by major providers so we are switching to a reputable provider
- Stripe: to act as a payment processor for future additions to the platform such as subscriptions

> - **Subscription** – a paid plan that provides access to additional features or services on Revolt ("Subscription", "Paid Service")
> - **Billing Cycle** – the period for which you are billed for a Subscription (e.g., monthly, yearly)

'Section 8: Subscriptions' has been added to the privacy policy to cover the future inclusion of paid subscriptions.

> ## 8. Subscriptions
>
> Some features of the Service may be available only through a paid Subscription.
>
> Subscriptions are available on a monthly or annual basis. Subscription fees are subject to change and may include applicable taxes. Accepted payment methods are listed on our payment page.
>
> - **Billing:** You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing Cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the Subscription plan you select.
> - **Payment:** You must provide accurate and complete billing information. By submitting payment information, you authorize us to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
> - **Renewal:** Your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or we cancel it. You may cancel your Subscription at any time through your account settings to avoid future charges.
> - **Free Trial:** If you sign up for a free trial (where available), you will be automatically converted to a paid Subscription at the end of the trial period unless you cancel before the trial ends.
> - **Cancellation:** If you cancel your Subscription, you will retain access to Subscription features until the end of your current Billing Cycle. No refunds will be provided for the remaining period of the Subscription after cancellation, except where required by law or in the event of a billing error.
> - **Account Termination:** If your account is terminated for violating these Terms or our Community Guidelines, your Subscription will be automatically cancelled and you will lose access to your Subscription and any associated features. No refunds will be provided for the remaining period of the Subscription after termination, except where required by law or in the event of a billing error.
> - **Changes to Subscription Terms:** We reserve the right to modify Subscription fees or terms at any time. Any fee or term change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle. We will provide you with at least 14 days' prior notice of any change in Subscription fees or terms to give you an opportunity to cancel your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
> - **User Responsibilities:** You are responsible for providing accurate and complete payment information and for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.
> - **Service Modifications:** We may modify or discontinue features of the Subscription service at any time. We will notify you of significant changes to the service. If a major feature is discontinued, you may be eligible for a partial refund at our discretion.
> - **Limitation of Liability:** In no event shall we be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages related to the Subscription service.
> - **Governing Law:** This agreement shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales.
